Final Project with module 8 journal

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I ensure that my project is functional and secure by following the safe coding practices as well as having test cases that can account for all feasible user-based possibilities.
  By following the safe coding practices given to me during my education, I can avoid corrupted data inputs, data leakes with data protection, a high standard of code quality and readability, and code testing and review for cases I may not have thought of.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? How do I approach desiging software?
  I interpret user needs by finding what they think their operating scope is. Asking the right questions on how they want their project ran, to be interacted with, and what other devices they want it to communicate with all help me uunderstand the clients needs.
  Once I find out what the client is looking for I build a rough outline or pseudo code and will compare it to the use cases the client gave me. Testing each dependency and making sure that the data is secure from class to class and from main to each class with the proper restrictions on each variable.
  After validating the pseudocode I begin the actual code of the project by implementing steps and verifing that they are valid both according to the pseudo code and the compiler. Finally after completing the code I run the test cases to verifiy that my solution works the way I intended and to that my logic was sound.
